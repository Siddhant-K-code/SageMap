# 🧠 SageMap

**Ever wondered if your brain has contradictory thoughts? Spoiler alert: it absolutely does.**

SageMap turns your stream-of-consciousness rambling into beautiful visualizations that reveal the messy, contradictory, and surprisingly interconnected web of your beliefs. Write about anything, and watch AI turn your thoughts into an interactive map of your mind.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

We all think we're consistent, logical beings. We're not. SageMap proves it by:

- **🔍 Finding Your Contradictions**: "Money isn't important" vs "I need money to be happy"
- **🕸️ Mapping Your Mind**: See how your beliefs connect (or clash) in real-time
- **📈 Tracking Your Evolution**: Watch your thinking change as you grow
- **⚡ Making Self-Reflection Actually Fun**: No more boring journal analysis

Perfect for those 3AM existential crisis sessions or when you want to prove to yourself that you're a walking contradiction.

- **Green dots**: Derived beliefs (conclusions you've reached)
- **Red lines**: Contradictions (prepare to be humbled)
- **Purple lines**: Evolution (how your thinking has grown)

## 🔒 Privacy Promise

- **100% Local Storage**: Your deepest thoughts stay in your browser
- **No Data Mining**: We don't see, store, or sell your beliefs
